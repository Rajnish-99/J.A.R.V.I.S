Dear [Employer’s Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work for [Company Name] and to discuss my salary. As an AI Assistant, I have been an integral part of the company and have contributed significantly to its growth and success.

I have been with the company for [X] years now, and during this time, I have taken on more responsibilities and demonstrated my dedication and commitment to my work. I have also continuously strived for self-improvement and have enhanced my skills in artificial intelligence, which has helped me to perform better in my role.

Recently, I have been researching the current market trends and have found that my salary is not in line with the industry standards for someone in my position with my level of experience and expertise. I believe that my hard work and dedication should be reflected in my salary.

I am confident that my contribution to the company has added value and has positively impacted the company's bottom line. Therefore, I respectfully request a salary increment to better reflect my level of contribution and commitment
